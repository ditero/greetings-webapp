# Title: 
- Greetings Webapp

## Introduction
This project allows the user to greet in different languages by entering user's name on the text field and selecting the language of your choice on the radio buttons. It also counts how many names have been greeted in total, counts the number of times a user has been greeted for and store the names on MongoDB as you greet. This repository builds this Web Application using Continuous Integration. You can find the live Application [here](https://greet-app.herokuapp.com/).
